# NVIDIA NeMo Fabric

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fabric-hero.png" alt="Architecture diagram showing NeMo Fabric as a central harness-management layer connecting deployment, evaluation, and RL rollout systems to Hermes, Codex, Claude Code, and LangChain DeepAgent while producing artifacts, telemetry, and logs." width="1000">
</p>

NeMo Fabric is a runtime execution layer that connects deployment platforms, evaluation harnesses, and RL rollout harnesses to multiple agent runtimes through one configurable, observable lifecycle surface.

You choose an agent harness-Hermes Agent, Codex, Claude Code, LangChain Deep Agents, or another harness integrated through a custom adapter-and call NeMo Fabric from your application or an evaluation harness such as Harbor; NeMo Fabric manages the harness lifecycle, and returns normalized results and artifacts.

## Installation

NeMo Fabric is capable of running in a seperate environment than the one used to run the agent harness, this avoids any potential dependency conflicts between the two.

Create an environment for NeMo Fabric, and install it.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install nemo-fabric[runtime]
```

In the environment used to run the agent harness, install the matching adapter for your agent harness. For example the Hermes Agent adapter:
```bash
pip install "nemo-fabric[hermes]"
```

**Supported Harnesses**

| Agent harness | Package extra |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `nemo-fabric[claude]` |
| Codex | `nemo-fabric[codex]` |
| Hermes Agent | `nemo-fabric[hermes]` |
| LangChain Deep Agents | `nemo-fabric[deepagents]` |

Refer to [the installation guide](docs/getting-started/install.mdx) for more details.

## Quick Start

### Obtain API Keys

The following code example uses an NVIDIA-hosted model and requires an NVIDIA API key defined with the `NVIDIA_API_KEY`
environment variable. An API key can be obtained by creating an account on [`build.nvidia.com`](https://build.nvidia.com/).


```python
import asyncio

from nemo_fabric import (
    Fabric,
    FabricConfig,
    HarnessConfig,
    MetadataConfig,
    ModelConfig,
)

config = FabricConfig(
    metadata=MetadataConfig(name="quickstart-agent"),
    harness=HarnessConfig(adapter_id="nvidia.fabric.hermes"),
    models={
        "default": ModelConfig(
            provider="nvidia",
            model="nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b",
            api_key_env="NVIDIA_API_KEY",
        )
    },
)

result = asyncio.run(Fabric().run(config, input="Who are you?"))
print(result.output.response)
```

In the above example, the choice of harness is set by the `adapter_id` in the `HarnessConfig`. The example uses the Hermes Agent adapter, but you can change it to any other supported harness by changing the `adapter_id` to the appropriate value. Any harness-specific settings can be made by passing a dictionary to the `settings` field of the `HarnessConfig`.

### Next Steps

- A more detailed version of this example is available as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) at [`examples/notebooks/01_quickstart.ipynb`](examples/notebooks/01_quickstart.ipynb). Refer to [`examples/notebooks/README.md`](examples/notebooks/README.md) for other example notebooks.
- Refer to the [Python SDK guide](docs/sdk/python.mdx): typed configuration, planning, diagnostics, requests, multi-turn runtimes, parallelism, results, and errors.


## Architecture

NeMo Fabric standardizes how applications configure, launch, invoke, and collect
artifacts from agent harnesses.

NeMo Fabric provides:

- a versioned, typed `FabricConfig` contract constructed through the SDK;
- ordinary Python composition for harness and experiment variants;
- adapter descriptors for harness-specific launch and control;
- a Rust core, Python SDK, and standalone experimentation CLI;
- JSON Schema snapshots for the public config and runtime contract;
- normalized run results, artifact manifests, and telemetry references.

## Core Concepts

- **Typed config:** callers construct a complete `FabricConfig` in Python.
  Start with the [Python SDK guide](docs/sdk/python.mdx), and refer to
  [`examples/code_review_agent/config.py`](examples/code_review_agent/config.py)
  for a complete application example.
- **Variants:** ordinary Python functions copy and modify complete configs to
  vary the harness, model, MCP, tools, skills, telemetry, or environment.
- **Experimentation CLI:** presets provide quick probes, examples provide
  maintained runnable workflows, and `example init` generates editable Python
  or Rust applications that call a language API directly.
- **Tools policy:** use top-level `tools.blocked` for harness-neutral blocked
  tool policy. Names are interpreted by the selected adapter:

  ```python
  config.block_tools("browser", "shell")
  ```

  The selected adapter interprets these names: Hermes Agent maps them to disabled
  toolsets, Claude maps them to `disallowed_tools`, Deep Agents enforces them
  with middleware, and adapters without a native deny mechanism route the
  policy as unsupported.
- **Adapters:** harness-specific integrations selected by `harness.adapter_id`.
  The Hermes Agent adapter lives under `adapters/hermes/`; the Codex adapter lives under `adapters/codex/`; the
  [Claude adapter](adapters/claude/README.md)
  lives under `adapters/claude/`; the LangChain Deep Agents adapter lives under
  `adapters/deepagents/`. Harness Agent-specific extensions belong under
  `harness.settings` so the normalized contract can remain stable.
- **Artifacts:** normalized output, logs, patches, and telemetry references
  returned through an `ArtifactManifest`.

NeMo Fabric accepts complete typed configs. Compose variants in Python before
calling the SDK. Refer to the [Python SDK guide](docs/sdk/python.mdx) for the
complete public API, type definitions, lifecycle semantics, and error behavior.

`run(...)` owns the complete start, invoke, and stop lifecycle. For typed
in-memory configuration, planning and diagnostics, explicit requests,
multi-turn runtimes, application-owned parallelism, results, and errors, see
the [Python SDK guide](docs/sdk/python.mdx). Exact signatures are in the
[generated Python API reference](docs/reference/api/python-library-reference/index.md).
